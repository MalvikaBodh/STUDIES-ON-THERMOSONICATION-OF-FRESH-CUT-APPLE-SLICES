# STUDIES-ON-THERMOSONICATION-OF-FRESH-CUT-APPLE-SLICES
Enzymatic browning is the second largest cause of quality loss in fruits and vegetables. Enzymatic browning and microbial growth lead to quality losses in apple products. In the present study, freshly cut apple slices were thermosonicated (at 28 KHz and different levels of treatment time and temperature) for the inactivation of enzymes (polyphenolase, peroxidase and pectin methyl esterase). The effect of thermosonication on apple cut slices was studied in terms of the changes in their physicochemical and bioactive changes. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of the samples increased with temperature and treatment time. With different temperature and exposure time combinations, the percentage inactivation of apple polyphenolase, peroxidase and pectin methyl esterase was determined. The inactivation obtained by thermosonic treatment for 30 min at 60 Â°C was 76.9, 90.9 and 80% for PME, PPO and POD respectively. The application of thermosonication was studied to enable less severe thermal treatments and, therefore, improve the quality of the blanched product.
